## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Email API Key

**Option A: SendGrid**
1. Sign up for a free SendGrid account at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Navigate to Settings → API Keys
3. Create a new API key with "Mail Send" permissions
4. Copy the API key (you'll only see it once!)

**Option B: Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)**
1. Sign up for a free Brevo account at [brevo.com](https://brevo.com)
2. Navigate to Settings → SMTP & API
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key (starts with `xkeysib-`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (copy from `.env.example`):

```env
# Email API Key (Brevo or SendGrid)
EMAIL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# From Email Address (must be verified in your email service)
FROM_EMAIL=info@theexcellenceservices.site

# From Name
FROM_NAME=The Excellence Services

# Server Port (optional, defaults to 3000)
PORT=3000
```

**Important:** 
- The `FROM_EMAIL` must be verified in your email service account
- Never commit the `.env` file to git (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- For production, use environment variables provided by your hosting platform

### 3. Run the Application Locally

You have several options to run the application:

#### Option 1: Using Python (Recommended - Easiest)

If you have Python installed:

1. Open terminal/command prompt in the project directory
2. Run one of these commands:

**Python 3:**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Python 2:**
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

3. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`

#### Option 2: Using Node.js (npx serve)

If you have Node.js installed:

1. Open terminal/command prompt in the project directory
2. Run:
```bash
npx serve
```

3. The server will start and show you the URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`)

#### Option 3: Using PHP

If you have PHP installed:

1. Open terminal/command prompt in the project directory
2. Run:
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

3. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`

#### Option 4: Using VS Code Live Server Extension

1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"
4. The app will open automatically in your browser

#### Option 5: Direct File Open (May have limitations)

Simply double-click `index.html` to open in your browser.

**⚠️ Note:** Opening directly may have CORS issues when reading Excel files. Using a local server (Options 1-4) is recommended.

#### Quick Start Commands

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cd D:\USIAD\SendGrid
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd /path/to/SendGrid
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open: **http://localhost:8000** in your browser

## Deployment to Vercel

### Prerequisites
- A Vercel account ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
- Your email API key (SendGrid or Brevo)
- Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push your code to Git**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Import project to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your Git repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect the project settings

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In your Vercel project dashboard, go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     EMAIL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     FROM_EMAIL=info@theexcellenceservices.site
     FROM_NAME=The Excellence Services
     ```
   - Make sure to add them for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development** environments

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy" (or push to your main branch to trigger auto-deployment)
   - Wait for the deployment to complete
   - Your app will be live at `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Vercel Configuration

The project includes a `vercel.json` file that configures:
- API routes to use the Node.js server
- Static file serving for the frontend
- Production environment settings

### Post-Deployment

After deployment, test your API endpoint:
- Health check: `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/health`
- Email API: `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/send-email`

## Deployment to AWS Amplify

### Overview
AWS Amplify Hosting serves the static frontend, while API routes are handled by AWS Lambda functions. This repository includes Lambda functions in `amplify/backend/function/` that replace the Express server endpoints.

### Prerequisites
- AWS account with Amplify Hosting enabled
- Git repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
- Verified sender/domain inside Brevo or SendGrid

### 1. Connect the repository
1. Push the project to your Git provider.
2. In the AWS console open **Amplify Hosting** → **Get started** → **Connect to Git provider**.
3. Select the repo/branch you want to deploy.

### 2. Configure build & environment
1. Amplify auto-detects the `amplify.yml`. Keep the defaults.
2. Under **Hosting → Environment variables**, add:
   ```
   EMAIL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   FROM_EMAIL=info@theexcellenceservices.site
   FROM_NAME=The Excellence Services
   ```
   Make sure to add these for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development** environments.

### 3. Create Lambda Functions (if not auto-detected)
If Amplify doesn't automatically detect the functions in `amplify/backend/function/`:

1. Go to **Hosting → Functions** in your Amplify app
2. Click **Create function**
3. For `/api/send-email`:
   - Function name: `sendEmail`
   - Source: Connect to your repository
   - Path: `amplify/backend/function/sendEmail/src`
   - Environment variables: Add the same variables as above
4. For `/api/health`:
   - Function name: `health`
   - Source: Connect to your repository
   - Path: `amplify/backend/function/health/src`

### 4. Configure Rewrites & Redirects
Go to **Hosting → Rewrites and redirects** and add:

```json
[
  {
    "source": "/api/send-email",
    "target": "/api/send-email",
    "status": "200",
    "type": "rewrite"
  },
  {
    "source": "/api/health",
    "target": "/api/health",
    "status": "200",
    "type": "rewrite"
  }
]
```

**Important**: Do NOT add a catch-all `/<*>` rule that rewrites to `/index.html` - this will break the API routes. The static files are served directly by Amplify.

### 5. Deploy & verify
1. Click **Save and deploy** (or push to your branch to trigger auto-deployment)
2. After the build succeeds, test:
   - Health check: `https://main.<id>.amplifyapp.com/api/health`
   - Send email: `https://main.<id>.amplifyapp.com/api/send-email`
3. Optionally connect a custom domain (App settings → Domain management)

### Alternative: Using Express Server (if SSR is available)
If your Amplify plan supports server-side rendering:
1. Go to **App settings → Build & deploy** (expand App settings in left sidebar)
2. Enable **Server-side rendering**
3. Set **Start command** to: `node server.js`
4. Add rewrite: `/api/<*>` → `/api/<*>` (200 Rewrite)
5. Redeploy

### Troubleshooting
- **301/404 errors on `/api/*`**: The Lambda functions aren't connected. Check **Hosting → Functions** and ensure they're deployed.
- **API errors**: Verify environment variables are set in **Hosting → Environment variables** (not just Build settings).
- **Build fails**: Ensure `package-lock.json` exists and Node.js version is compatible.

## Security Note

✅ **Secure Implementation:**

This application uses a secure backend proxy pattern:
- API keys are stored as environment variables (never in code)
- Frontend calls the backend API endpoint
- Backend securely handles the email service API calls
- No API keys are exposed to the client

**For Production:**
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Never commit `.env` files to git
- Use your hosting platform's environment variable management

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari
- Opera

## Dependencies (Loaded via CDN)

- Bootstrap 5.3.2
- Quill.js 1.3.6 (Rich text editor)
- SheetJS (xlsx.js) 0.18.5

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to parse Excel file"
- Ensure the file is a valid .xlsx or .xls format
- Check that the file is not corrupted
- Try opening it in Excel first

### "No valid email addresses found"
- Check that the selected column contains email addresses
- Ensure emails are in valid format (user@domain.com)
- Remove any empty rows

### "API connection failed"
- Verify your SendGrid API key is correct
- Check that the `fromEmail` is verified in SendGrid
- Ensure you have internet connectivity
- Check browser console for CORS errors (may need backend proxy)

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Reduce batch size in config
- Increase delay between batches
- Wait a few minutes and try again
